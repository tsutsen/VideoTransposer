# VideoTransposer
So, imagine a video as a three-dimensional array â€” 2D images stacked one on top of another. This app transposes this array and makes videos kinda quirky.

<i>You can use VideoTransposer for your videos but please mention [@leon.harlov](https://instagram.com/leon.harlov) if you are to post it on social media.
